        <!-- SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Who Was Karl Rahner?</h2>
            <div class="intro-box">
                <p><strong>Teacher's Introduction:</strong> Hello, class. Today, we're exploring the ideas of one of the 20th century's most important thinkers, a Catholic priest named Karl Rahner (1904-1984). His goal was to connect our deep questions about life, meaning, and God with the Christian faith. He wasn't interested in theology that was disconnected from real life. He asked: <strong>"How can we, as finite human beings, even begin to know an infinite God?"</strong></p>
            </div>
            <p>Think of Rahner as a <strong>bridge-builder</strong>. In his time, Catholic thought was often caught between two extremes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Fortress:</strong> A defensive approach that wanted to protect old traditions from the modern world at all costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Total Surrender:</strong> An approach that wanted to change the faith completely to fit in with modern ideas.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Rahner carved a path between these two. He built a theological bridge connecting God's profound mystery with the everyday questions of human life. His work was so groundbreaking that it deeply influenced the major Catholic event of the century: the Second Vatican Council.</p>

        <!-- SECTION 2: CORE CONCEPTS -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Two Foundational Ideas</h2>
            <div class="concept-grid">

                <!-- CARD 1: SUPERNATURAL EXISTENTIAL -->
                <div class="concept-card">
                    <h3>1. The Supernatural Existential</h3>
                    <p>This might sound like a complex philosophical term, but the idea behind it is both simple and beautiful. Let's break it down:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Existential:</strong> This refers to the very core of our existence—what it means to be a human being.</li>
                        <li><strong>Supernatural:</strong> This refers to God's grace—God's own life, love, and presence.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Rahner's revolutionary idea is that God's grace isn't something added to us from the outside, like frosting on a cake. Instead, <strong>God's grace is baked into the very recipe of what it means to be human.</strong> From the moment we exist, we are already living and breathing in God's presence.</p>
                    
                    <div class="illustration">
                        <h4>Illustration: The Fish and the Ocean</h4>
                        <p>Imagine a fish. It is born in water, it breathes water, it lives and moves entirely within water. The water is the fundamental condition for its existence. The fish might not be consciously thinking about "water" all the time—it's just the reality it lives in.</p>
                        <p>For Rahner, humanity is the fish, and <strong>God's grace is the ocean</strong>. We are created with a built-in orientation, a deep-seated longing for God. This longing is a permanent part of our human structure, placed there by God. We are beings who are always, in the core of our existence, reaching out toward the mystery we call God, whether we realize it or not.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <!-- CARD 2: ANONYMOUS CHRISTIANITY -->
                <div class="concept-card">
                    <h3>2. The "Anonymous Christian"</h3>
                    <p>This is Rahner's most famous and sometimes controversial idea. It flows directly from the "fish in the ocean" concept.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Question:</strong> If everyone exists in the "ocean" of God's grace, what about people who have never heard of Jesus or the Church? What about a sincere Buddhist, a kind-hearted atheist, or someone from a remote culture? Can they be saved?</p>
                    <p><strong>Rahner's Answer:</strong> Yes.</p>
                    <p>He argued that if a person genuinely follows their conscience, seeks truth, and lives a life of love and self-giving, they are responding to the grace of God that is already active in their life. They may not call that grace "Jesus," but they are accepting God's offer of love in the best way they know how. Rahner called such a person an <strong>"Anonymous Christian."</strong></p>

                    <div class="illustration">
                        <h4>Illustration: The Anonymous Benefactor</h4>
                        <p>Imagine an orphan who receives a monthly anonymous donation that pays for her education and living expenses. This gift allows her to grow, learn, and thrive. She doesn't know the benefactor's name, but she gratefully accepts the gift and uses it for good. Her life is fundamentally shaped by this generosity.</p>
                        <p>One day, she might learn the benefactor's name is "Christos." When she does, she won't feel like she's meeting a stranger. Instead, she'll realize, "So *that* was the name of the one who was helping me all along! Now I can finally thank him properly." For Rahner, Jesus is the ultimate benefactor. An "anonymous Christian" is someone who has been accepting the gift their whole life without yet knowing the giver's name.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

        <!-- SECTION 3: HOW REVELATION WORKS -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>How God Reaches Us: A Flowchart</h2>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Rahner saw God's self-revelation as a process. It's not all-or-nothing. It moves from a general, unspoken presence to a specific, historical event.</p>
            <div class="flowchart">
                <div class="flowchart-box">
                    <strong>Level 1: Transcendental Revelation</strong>  

                    <small>(The "Ocean" of Grace)</small>  

                    This is the universal presence of God's grace that every human experiences as a deep longing for truth, love, and meaning. It's the "supernatural existential."
                </div>
                <div class="flowchart-arrow">↓</div>
                <div class="flowchart-box">
                    <strong>Level 2: Categorical Revelation</strong>  

                    <small>(Moments of Grace in History)</small>  

                    This is when that general grace becomes concrete in a specific event, person, or experience. It can happen through nature, conscience, art, or within other world religions. This is where the "Anonymous Christian" lives.
                </div>
                <div class="flowchart-arrow">↓</div>
                <div class="flowchart-box">

                    <small>(The Person of Jesus Christ)</small>  

                    For Rahner, this is the ultimate, definitive, and clearest expression of God's love. In Jesus, God's self-gift is no longer anonymous but has a name and a face. This is the fulfillment toward which all other revelation points.
